One day coding challenge.
- Postman Collection has been uploaded to the repository.
- There are no exception usages due to restricted time. I prefer creating custom exception classes according to the needs.
- MySQL is used instead of PostgreSQL because had problems in PostgreSQL installation. I could not use it.
